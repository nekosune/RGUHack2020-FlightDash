            A class that allows to queue an Action so that it is executed in a Dispatcher.Invoke call,
            but only if another action is not already pending execution. This is useful for example to
            redraw the screen when a collection of item changes, doing so only once if the collection
            changes multiple times. Another example is redrawing an element when any of its properties
            change, while ensuring that if many properties are changed, the element is redrawn only once.

            <summary>
            Provides common methods for sending data to and receiving data from a resource
            identified by a URI.
            </summary>
            <example>
            Here is an example of a use of the WebClient to receive data:
            <code lang="C#">
            //We create the WebClient with the right encoding and headers:
            var webClient = new WebClient();
            webClient.Encoding = Encoding.UTF8;
            webClient.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.Accept] = "application/xml";
            
            //We submit the request to the server and wait for its response:
            string response = await webClient.DownloadStringTaskAsync("http://someAddress.com");
            
            //We modify the response so that it can be deserialized (deserialization is not perfect yet):
            response = response.Replace(@"xmlns=""http://NameSpaceOfTheDeserialization""", "");
            response = "&lt;ToDoItemsWrapper&gt;" + response.Replace("ArrayOfToDoItem", "ToDoItems") + "&lt;/ToDoItemsWrapper&gt;"; // Workaround for the fact that "ArrayOf" types cannot be directly deserialized by the XmlSerializer in this Beta version.
            
            //We create the Deserializer:
            var deserializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(ToDoItemsWrapper));
            var memoryStream = new MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(response));
            var xmlReader = XmlReader.Create(memoryStream);
            
            //We deserialize:
            ToDoItemsWrapper items = (ToDoItemsWrapper)deserializer.Deserialize(xmlReader);
            </code>
            Here is what the ToDoItemsWrapper class looks like (with ToDoItem a Serializable class) :
            <code lang="C#">
            // Workaround for the fact that "ArrayOf" types cannot directly be deserialized by the XmlSerializer in this Beta version:
            [DataContract]
            public class ToDoItemsWrapper
            {
                public List&lt;ToDoItem&gt; ToDoItems { get; set; }
            }
            </code>
            Here is another example that shows how you can use the WebClient to send data:
            <code lang="C#">
            //We parse the data in a string:
            string data = string.Format(@"{{""Id"": ""{0}"",""Description"": ""{1}""}}"Guid.NewGuid(), MyTextBox.Text.Replace("\"", "'"));
            //We create the WebClient:
            var webClient = new WebClient();
            We set the encoding and Headers (note: our data is formatted in json so we set the HttpRequestHeader.ContentType header accordingly) 
            webClient.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.ContentType] = "application/json";
            webClient.Encoding = Encoding.UTF8;
            string response = await webClient.UploadStringTaskAsync("http://cshtml5-rest-sample.azurewebsites.net/api/Todo/", "POST", data);
            </code>

        <member name="T:Windows.UI.Xaml.Data.Binding">
            <summary>
            Defines a binding that connects the properties of binding targets and data sources.
            </summary>
            <example>
            You can add a Binding using XAML as follows:
            <code lang="XAML" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml">
            <TextBlock x:Name="MyTextBlock"
                       Text="{Binding Size}"
                       HorizontalAlignment="Left"/>
            </code>
            <code lang="C#">
            MyTextBlock.DataContext = myPlanet;
            </code>
            Note: you can create the Binding directly using C#:
            <code lang="C#">
            Binding myBinding = new Binding(&quot;Size&quot;);
            MyTextBlock.SetBinding(TextBlock.TextProperty, myBinding);
            MyTextBlock.DataContext = myPlanet;
            </code>
            Here is another example using the TwoWay mode, and also using a Converter:
            <code lang="C#">
            MyTextBox.DataContext = myPlanet;
            </code>
            <code lang="XAML" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" xmlns:local="using:MyAssembly.MyApp">
            <Border>
            <!-- We define the Converter: -->
                <Border.Resources>
                    <local:KilometersToMilesConverter x:Key="KilometersToMilesConverter"/>
                </Border.Resources>
                <TextBox x:Name="MyTextBox"
                         Text="{Binding Length, Mode=TwoWay, Converter={StaticResource KilometersToMilesConverter}}"
                         HorizontalAlignment="Left"/>
            </Border>
            </code>
            Using C#:
            <code lang="C#">
            Binding myBinding = new Binding(&quot;Size&quot;);
            
            //we set the binding in TwoWay mode:
            myBinding.Mode = BindingMode.TwoWay;
            
            //We create the converter:
            myBinding.Converter = new KilometersToMilesConverter();
            
            MyTextBox.SetBinding(TextBox.TextProperty, myBinding);
            MyTextBox.DataContext = myPlanet;

            Provides a timer that is integrated into the Dispatcher queue, which is processed
            at a specified interval of time and at a specified priority.  One scenario
            for this is to run code on the UI thread.
            </summary>
            <example>
            Here is how you can create and use a DispatcherTimer:
            <code lang="C#">
            DispatcherTimer _dispatcherTimer;
            </code>
            <code lang="C#">
            //We create a new instance of DispatcherTimer:
            _dispatcherTimer = new Dispatchertimer();
            //we set the time between each tick of the DispatcherTimer to 100 milliseconds:
            timer.Interval = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 0, 100);
            _dispatcherTimer.Tick += DispatcherTimer_Tick;
            _dispatcherTimer.Start();
            </code>
            <code lang="C#">
            void DispatcherTimer_Tick(object sender, object e)
            {
                //Some code to execute at each Tick of the DispatcherTimer.
            }
            </code>
            When you want to stop the DispatcherTimer, you can use the following code:
            <code lang="C#">
                _dispatcherTimer.Stop();
            </code>
